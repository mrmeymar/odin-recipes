    <br><h1><strong>Preparation</strong>: 5 mins     <strong>Cook</strong>: 5 mins</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>3 eggs</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp sunflower oil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp butter</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h1><strong>Method</strong></h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong> Step 1:</strong><br>Season the beaten eggs well with salt and pepper. Heat the oil and butter 
            <br>in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat until the butter has melted and is foaming.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>Pour the eggs into the pan, tilt the pan ever so slightly from one side to another to allow the eggs to swirl and cover 
            <br>the surface of the pan completely. Let the mixture cook for
            <br>about 20 seconds then scrape a line through the middle with a spatula.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>Tilt the pan again to allow it to fill back up with the runny egg.
            <br>Repeat once or twice more until the egg has just set.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong>At this point you can fill the omelette with whatever you like. 
                <br>Some grated cheese, sliced ham, fresh herbs, saut√©ed mushrooms or smoked salmon all work well. 
                <br>Scatter the filling over the top of the omelette and fold gently in half with the spatula. Slide onto a plate to serve.</li>
    </ol>
