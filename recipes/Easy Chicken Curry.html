          <h2>How to thicken curry sauce</h2>
          <p>If you find your sauce is on the runny side, there are several ways to fix this. Here are our top 3 methods:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Simmering gently on a low temperature will reduce the volume of liquid as well as intensifying the flavour of the curry.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp cornflour to 2-3 tbsp of cold water to form a slurry. Then add this to the curry and simmer until it thickens.</li>
            <li>Add a few tbsp of Greek yogurt, which will give the curry a lovely creamy consistency too.</li>
          </ol>
