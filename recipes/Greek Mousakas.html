            <li>1/2 tbsp light brown soft sugar</li>
            <li>550g Maris Piper potatoes</li>
            <li>For the béchamel sauce:</li>
            <li>40g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>40g plain flour</li>
            <li>450ml whole milk</li>
            <li>40g parmesan</li>
            <li>whole nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Method</strong></h2>
        <or>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>Heat a frying pan over a high heat. Drizzle 4 tbsp of the oil over the slices of aubergine 
                <br>and fry them in several batches for 5-7 mins or until golden brown and beginning to soften.
                <br>If they look a little dry during cooking, add a dash more olive oil. Set aside on a plate lined with kitchen paper.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large flameproof casserole dish or saucepan over a medium-high heat.
                <br>Add the mince and fry for 8-10 mins until a deep golden brown, regularly stirring and breaking up with a wooden spoon.
                <br>Tip into a bowl and set aside. Add the remaining oil to the casserole. Tip in the onion along with a pinch of salt
                <br>and fry gently for 10-12 mins or until softened and turning translucent. Add the garlic, oregano, cinnamon and bay cooking for a further min.
                <br>Return the lamb to the pan and pour in the red wine, bring to a bubble and reduce the wine by half. Stir through the tomatoes, tomato purée and
                <br>brown sugar, along with 200ml water. Season. 
                <br>Lower the heat and simmer gently, uncovered, for 20 mins, stirring occasionally until the sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>Heat oven to 200C/180 fan/gas 4. Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil. 
                <br>Add the potato slices and cook for 6 mins, drain in a colander and leave to steam dry for 10 mins.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong><br>Melt the butter in a small saucepan, stir in the flour and cook over a medium heat for 1 min.
                <br>Remove from the heat and whisk in the milk, pouring in a bit at a time, until smooth. Return to the heat and bring to a simmer, cooking for 3 mins. 
                <br>Remove from the heat and whisk through the parmesan, a little grated nutmeg and some seasoning, and finally the whole egg as well as the yolk.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5:</strong><br>Take a large rectangular ovenproof dish. Spoon a third of the meat into the dish and spread out evenly, 
                <br>followed by half the aubergine and half the potato, then the rest of the meat and another layer of aubergines, followed by potatoes. 
                <br>Finish with the béchamel, smoothing the top over with a palette knife. Put in the centre of the oven
                <br>and cook for 50 mins or until deep golden brown. 
                <br>If it browns too much during cooking, cover the dish. Set aside for 10 mins to cool before serving.</li>
